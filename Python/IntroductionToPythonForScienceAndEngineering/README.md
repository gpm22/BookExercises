# **Introduction to Python for Science and Egineering** by David Pine

## Description of the book

This guide offers a quick and incisive introduction to Python programming for anyone. The author has carefully developed a concise approach to using Python in any discipline of science and engineering, with plenty of examples, practical hints, and insider tips.

Readers will see why Python is such a widely appealing program, and learn the basics of syntax, data structures, input and output, plotting, conditionals and loops, user-defined functions, curve fitting, numerical routines, animation, and visualization. The author teaches by example and assumes no programming background for the reader.
