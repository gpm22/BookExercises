# **Introduction to Python for Science and Egineering** by David Pine

## Description of the book

Programming problems that seem new or unique are usually rooted in well-known engineering principles. *Classic Computer Science Problems in Python* guides you through time-tested scenarios, exercises, and algorithms that will prepare you for the "new" problems you'll face when you start your next project.

In this amazing book, you'll tackle dozens of coding challenges, ranging from simple tasks like binary search algorithms to clustering data using k-means. As you work through examples for web development, machine learning, and more, you'll remember important things you've forgotten and discover classic solutions that will save you hours of time.
